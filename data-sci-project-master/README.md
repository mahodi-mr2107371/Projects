## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.7 or higher
* pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mahodi-mr2107371/Projects.git
   cd Projects/data-sci-project-master
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

   ```

## 📊 Project Overview

This project aims to \[provide a brief description of the project's purpose, e.g., "predict housing prices based on various features such as location, size, and amenities."] It involves:

* Data collection and cleaning
* Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
* Feature engineering
* Model selection and training
* Model evaluation and validation
* Deployment considerations

## 🧪 Usage

1. **Data Preprocessing:**

   Navigate to the `scripts/` directory and run the data preprocessing script:

   ```bash
   python data_preprocessing.py
   ```

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis:**

   Open the EDA notebook located in the `notebooks/` directory to visualize and understand the data:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook eda.ipynb
   ```

3. **Model Training:**

   Execute the model training script:

   ```bash
   python model_training.py
   ```

   The trained model will be saved in the `models/` directory.

4. **Model Evaluation:**

   Run the evaluation script to assess model performance:

   ```bash
   python model_evaluation.py
   ```
